### MATH OPERATORS (08)
# Fist is *, second is division the addition and subtraction

x = 15
y = 7
# + addition
# - subtrction
# * multiply
# / division
# % module (remainder after division)
# ** power
# // floor division

print(x + y)
print(x - y)
print(x*y)
print(x/y)
print(x%y)
print(x**y)
print(x//y)

## Assignment operators
x = 5
x = 5 + x # or x+=2
          # You can also use -= *= /= .
          #  There are 5 additional operators in Python
y = 7

print(x)

## Math Functions
x = min(5,10,25) # get minimum
print(x)

x = max(10,15,20) # get maximum
print(x)

x = abs(-y)       # get absolute value
print(x)

x = pow(3,2)      # get 5 up to the 2 power
print(x)
