### COLLECTION OF DATA: list, tuple, set, dictionary (12- Theory)

## Characteristics of a data collection: 
# - ordered: elements have a defined order
# - indexing: elements are accessible by an index
# - editable: elements can be modified, removed or added 
# - immutable: elements cannot be modified, removed or added 
# - allow duplicates: elements can be duplicated 

# Important: if elements are ordered you can access them by an index

## Data collection definitions
# - Lists are ordered and editable data collection. Lists allow duplicates
# - Tuples are ordered and immutable data collection. Tuple allow duplicates

# - Sets are unordered and unindexed data collection. Sets do not allow duplicates. (elements cannot be modified)
# - Dictionaries are ordered and editable data collection (version 3.7). Dictionaries do not allow duplicates.
